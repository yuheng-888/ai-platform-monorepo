**Resin** is a **high-performance intelligent proxy pool gateway** built for operating massive numbers of proxy nodes.

It helps shield your services from unstable upstream proxies and aggregates them into a single HTTP gateway with **session stickiness (sticky routing)**.

## 💡 Why Resin?

- **Massive-scale management**: Easily handles 100k+ proxy nodes with native high-concurrency performance.
- **Smart scheduling and circuit breaking**: Fully automated **passive + active** health checks, outbound IP probing, and latency analysis to remove bad nodes precisely. Uses P2C plus domain-aware latency-weighted scoring for optimal node selection.
- **Business-friendly sticky proxying**: Keeps the same business account bound to a stable outbound IP. If a node fails, Resin seamlessly switches to another node with the same IP.
- **Dual access modes**: Supports both standard forward proxy (HTTP Proxy) and URL-based reverse proxy.
- **Observability**: Detailed metrics and logs, plus a visual Web UI. Includes complete structured request logs for querying and auditing by platform, account, target site, and more.
- **Simple and powerful**: Works out of the box with default settings, while still offering deep customization for enterprise-grade needs.
- **Cross-subscription deduplication**: Automatically merges identical nodes from different subscriptions and shares their health state.
- **Hot reload**: Update common settings without restart. Refresh subscriptions without dropping existing traffic.
- **Persistent state**: Keeps node health, latency stats, and lease bindings across restarts.
- **Zero-intrusion sticky access**: Can extract account identity from existing request headers (for example API keys), so clients often need no code changes.
- **Incremental subscription refresh**: Syncs subscription updates without interrupting current connections.
- **Flexible node isolation**: Use Platform rules (regex, region, etc.) to build independent proxy pools for different business scenarios.

## 🔌 Supported Protocols and Subscription Formats

### Subscription sources

- Remote subscription URL: `http://` or `https://`.
- Local subscription content: paste subscription content directly in the UI/API.

### Subscription content formats

- sing-box JSON: `{"outbounds":[...]}` or raw outbound array `[...]`.
- Clash JSON/YAML: `{"proxies":[...]}` or YAML `proxies:`.
- URI line format (one node per line): `vmess://`, `vless://`, `trojan://`, `ss://`, `hysteria2://`, `http://`, `https://`, `socks5://`, `socks5h://`.
  For `http://`, `https://`, `socks5://`, `socks5h://`, use `scheme://[user:pass@]host:port` (optional `#tag`; `https` also supports `sni`/`servername`/`peer` and `allowInsecure`/`insecure` query parameters).
- Plain HTTP proxy lines: `IP:PORT` or `IP:PORT:USER:PASS` (IPv4 and IPv6).
- Base64-wrapped text subscriptions (for URI lines/plain-text node lists).

### Supported outbound node types

- For sing-box JSON/raw outbounds: `socks`, `http`, `shadowsocks`, `vmess`, `trojan`, `wireguard`, `hysteria`, `vless`, `shadowtls`, `tuic`, `hysteria2`, `anytls`, `ssh`.
- For Clash conversion: `ss`/`shadowsocks`, `socks`/`socks4`/`socks4a`/`socks5`, `http`, `vmess`, `vless`, `trojan`, `wireguard`/`wg`, `hysteria`, `hysteria2`/`hy2`, `tuic`, `anytls`, `ssh`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

In just three steps, you can turn your proxy subscriptions into a highly available proxy pool.

### Step 1: Deploy and start

Docker Compose is the recommended quick-start path:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  resin:
    image: ghcr.io/resinat/resin:latest
    container_name: resin
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      RESIN_AUTH_VERSION: "V1" # Required: LEGACY_V0 or V1
      RESIN_ADMIN_TOKEN: "admin123" # Change to your admin dashboard password
      RESIN_PROXY_TOKEN: "my-token" # Change to your proxy password
      RESIN_LISTEN_ADDRESS: 0.0.0.0
      RESIN_PORT: 2260
    ports:
      - "2260:2260"
    volumes:
      - ./data/cache:/var/cache/resin
      - ./data/state:/var/lib/resin
      - ./data/log:/var/log/resin
```

Run `docker compose up -d` to start the service.

*(If you don't want Docker, jump to [Other Deployment Options](#other-deployment-options).)*

### Step 2: Import proxy nodes

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:2260` in your browser (replace with your server IP if needed).
2. Log in with the `RESIN_ADMIN_TOKEN` you set.
3. Go to **Subscriptions** in the left menu and add your node subscription.
4. Wait briefly for the node pool to refresh.

### Step 3: Start sending proxy requests

Use one of the client access modes in the following sections.

## 🟢 Basic Usage (Non-sticky Proxy)

### Connect as a standard proxy

If you just need a high-performance, large-capacity proxy pool with automatic health management, Resin works out of the box.

Once Resin is running, point your app to `http://127.0.0.1:2260`.
If you do not want a proxy password, explicitly set `RESIN_PROXY_TOKEN=""` (the variable must still be defined). Then connect directly to `http://127.0.0.1:2260`.

Example with curl:

```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:2260 \
  -U ":my-token" \
  https://api.ipify.org
```

If your client supports overriding `BASE_URL`, you can also use reverse-proxy mode.
URL format: `/token/Platform(optional).Account(optional)/protocol/target`.
Example request to `https://api.ipify.org`:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:2260/my-token/./https/api.ipify.org
```

> Choosing forward vs reverse proxy: when possible, reverse proxy is recommended for better observability. If your client cannot change BaseURL, or requires scenarios better served by forward proxy (such as uTLS or non-WebAPI traffic), use forward proxy.

### Filter nodes

If your service needs specific nodes (for example by region, subscription source, or name regex), use Resin's Platform feature.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:2260/ui/platforms` and create a Platform. For example, to use only US and HK nodes, create `MyPlatform` and set region filters to:

```
us
hk
```

For forward proxy, put Platform in proxy auth info:

```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:2260 \
  -U "MyPlatform:my-token" \
  https://api.ipify.org
```

For reverse proxy, include Platform in the URL prefix:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:2260/my-token/MyPlatform/https/api.ipify.org
```

## 📖 Advanced Usage: Sticky Session Proxy

When your business depends on IP continuity or long-lived interactions, use Resin's core feature: **sticky proxying**.

First, understand two core concepts:

### 🎯 Core Concepts: Platform and Account

- **Platform**: An isolated node pool. You can build it with filters (for example, only US nodes). Resin provides a default `Default` platform containing all available nodes.
- **Account**: A unique business identity (for example `Tom` or `user_1`). For requests carrying an Account, Resin anchors traffic to a dedicated high-quality outbound node. If that node fails, Resin retries seamlessly and switches to another node with the same IP.

### Sticky proxy access formats

#### Method 1: Forward proxy (HTTP Proxy)

With `RESIN_AUTH_VERSION=V1`, the identity format is: `Platform.Account:RESIN_PROXY_TOKEN`.

> To keep the legacy V0 format, set `RESIN_AUTH_VERSION=LEGACY_V0` and continue using `RESIN_PROXY_TOKEN:Platform:Account`.

Write identity directly in proxy auth username:

```bash
# V1 format: -U "platform.account:token"
# Bind business account user_tom to a stable dedicated outbound IP
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:2260 \
  -U "Default.user_tom:my-token" \
  https://api.ipify.org
```

#### Method 2: Reverse proxy (URL Account, quick/manual debug)

By replacing your service BaseURL with Resin reverse-proxy URL, traffic goes through Resin directly.
Advanced URL format: `http://host:2260/token/platform.account/protocol/target`:

```bash
# Example: user_tom accesses api.ipify.org over https
curl "http://127.0.0.1:2260/my-token/Default.user_tom/https/api.ipify.org"
```

> The URL Account segment is designed for quick use and manual debugging.
> For long-running production integrations, prefer passing Account by header (`X-Resin-Account`).

#### Method 3: Reverse proxy + `X-Resin-Account` header (recommended production integration)

If your client/SDK supports custom request headers, pass Account explicitly with `X-Resin-Account`.
This is the recommended and most stable method.

Account source priority: `X-Resin-Account` header > Account in reverse-proxy URL > header extraction rules.

Example:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:2260/my-token/MyPlatform/https/api.example.com/v1/orders" \
  -H "X-Resin-Account: user_tom"
```

#### Method 4: Reverse proxy + header rules (zero/low-intrusion integration)

If your client cannot set `X-Resin-Account`, Resin can still extract Account from existing business headers (for example API Key, Token, Cookie) via header rules.

Assume your requests already include an `Authorization` header:

1. In Platform Configuration, set `Reverse-proxy empty-account behavior` to `Extract specified request headers as Account`.
2. Set `Headers used to extract Account` to `Authorization`.

Then even if Account is omitted in URL, Resin can still parse it from headers:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:2260/my-token/MyPlatform/https/api.example.com/v1/orders" \
  -H "Authorization: sk-abc123"
```

In this example, Resin uses `sk-abc123` as Account. Future requests with the same key are intended to stay bound to the same outbound IP whenever routing conditions allow.

> [!TIP]
> Beyond Platform header config, Resin also supports advanced rules that pick extraction headers by URL prefix. You can ask AI to explain both modes with this README and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

> Enable header-based Account extraction only when you have a valid legal basis (for example user authorization or contractual permission), and ensure your logging, retention, and access-control policies comply with applicable laws and target-service terms.

## 🤖 Integrating Third-party Projects

Different clients integrate Resin differently, with different code-intrusion levels.

💡 **If you do not need sticky proxying**

| Access Method | Code Intrusion | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Forward proxy | 🟢 **Zero intrusion** | Just configure proxy address `http://127.0.0.1:2260` and credentials. |
| Reverse proxy | 🟢 **Zero/low intrusion** | Usually only requires changing service BaseURL. |

💡 **If you need sticky proxying**

| Access Method | Code Intrusion | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Forward proxy | 🟡 **Medium intrusion** | Per-user requests need different auth info, such as `platform.account:token` (V1). |
| Reverse proxy | 🟡 **Medium intrusion** | Add `X-Resin-Account` request header or build reverse-proxy URL paths dynamically with account information. |
| Reverse proxy + header rules | 🟢 **Zero/low intrusion** | Resin can extract Account from original headers (for example `Authorization`) and bind IP automatically. |

## 🛠️ FAQ

- **Q: Startup fails with `RESIN_PROXY_TOKEN` undefined?**
  - **A**: Even if you do not want a proxy password, you must explicitly set it to empty: `RESIN_PROXY_TOKEN=""`.
- **Q: Startup fails with `RESIN_AUTH_VERSION` undefined?**
  - **A**: Set it to `LEGACY_V0` or `V1`. For new deployments, use `V1`. For upgrades with legacy data, see [doc/v1.0.0-migration-guide.md](doc/v1.0.0-migration-guide.md).
- **Q: Is there a dedicated v1.0.0 migration guide?**
  - **A**: Yes. See [doc/v1.0.0-migration-guide.md](doc/v1.0.0-migration-guide.md).
- **Q: How to write reverse-proxy paths for WebSocket (ws/wss)?**
  - **A**: In the URL path, the protocol field must still be `http` or `https` (not `ws`/`wss`). Resin auto-detects and handles WebSocket upgrade.
